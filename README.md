# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

A simple number guessing game in Python where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides randomized feedback, hints, and difficulty levels.

## How to Play

    Run the script:

    python game.py

    Choose a difficulty level:
        easy: 10 attempts

    Enter your guesses. The game will provide feedback:
        "Too high!" if your guess is above the correct answer
        "Too low!" if your guess is below the correct answer
        A hint (even/odd) appears after a few wrong attempts
    If you guess correctly, you win!
